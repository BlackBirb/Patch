Still working on it
## About
Patch is a discord bot with tons of cool functions!
- Playing music
- Games
- Moderating stuff
- etc. idk
## Usage
If you want Patch on your own server you can add her with [this link](later)!
By default Patch will react to `!` or mention as prefix. So start with `!help`.

You can configure a lot of stuff on her [website](really.later)!

Or you can host it on your own, it's easy! But not yet avaible... wait >.-.< You can try to clone this repository and create config.json with things needed, but that might be not enough. idk 
## Other
Patch as a character belongs to Magic3w you can find her blog [here](http://ask.patch.cat/) (It's dead since 24 nov 2016 [\*]) I'm not trying to steal her or anything, I'm just really big fan.

But all the code here is done by me. You can find me on Discord @ BlackBird#9999
